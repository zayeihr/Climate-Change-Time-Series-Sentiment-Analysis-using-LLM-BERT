This project leverages ClimateBERT to classify climate-related paragraphs into three sentiment categories: opportunity, neutral, or risk. This classification can help understand public perception and media portrayal of climate issues, aiding in informed decision-making for policymakers, researchers, and organizations.

# Objectives
Sentiment Classification: Develop a system that accurately classifies climate-related texts into sentiment categories.
Data Analysis: Explore and understand sentiment distribution and trends in climate-related discussions.
Visualization: Create informative visualizations to easily interpret sentiment data.
